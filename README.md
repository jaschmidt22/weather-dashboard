# Weather Dashboard

## Description

I was given the challenge of creating a weather application that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The user must be able to search for a city and then be presented with the current forecast, and the forecast for the following 5 days. The date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity should also be displayed. During the building process, I learned how to use third-party APIs to access their data and functionality by making specific requests to a URL.

## Usage

I created a weather application that runs in the browser. The app consists of a search box in the upper left corner to enter the name of the city. Once the name of the city is entered, the name, date and current forecast are shown in the center of the screen. Also, the 5-day forecast will appear in blue boxes underneath. I used a third-party API to access their data and functionality to dynamically update my HTML and CSS to populate all the forecast data.

## Credits

Throughout the making of this project, I frequently referenced https://openweathermap.org/api and my class repository ASU-VIRT-FSF-PT-10-2023-U-LOLC. I also referenced Google, W3Schools, MDN Webdocs, Day.js, Bootstrap, and ChatGPT. I also worked with a tutor, Trinh Nguyen, who helped me with some mistakes that I made.
